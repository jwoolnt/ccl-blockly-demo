# Blockly Demo

This is a small demo repository made for the purpose of learning the basics of Google's [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) library. The guide used to create the demo, "Getting started with Blockly," is available on the [Blockly's Codelabs Site](https://blocklycodelabs.dev) which hosts several other codelabs teaching various concepts ("Build a custom generator," "Build custom renderers," etcetera).
